# Aggregation Framework in MongoDB

The aggregation framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool that allows you to process data records and return computed results. It provides a way to perform advanced data manipulations and transformations on documents within a collection. This framework is particularly useful for tasks such as data analysis, reporting, and data summarization.

## Key Features of the Aggregation Framework

- **Pipeline**: The aggregation framework uses a pipeline approach, where documents pass through multiple stages. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data, such as filtering, grouping, or sorting.

- **Stages**: Some common stages include:
  - `$match`: Filters documents to pass only those that match the specified condition.
  - `$group`: Groups documents by a specified key and allows for the computation of aggregates (e.g., sum, average).
  - `$sort`: Sorts the documents based on specified fields.
  - `$project`: Reshapes each document, allowing you to include, exclude, or create new fields.
  - `$lookup`: Performs a left outer join to another collection.

- **Flexibility**: The framework allows for complex queries and can handle diverse data types and structures, making it suitable for a variety of applications.

- **Performance**: Aggregation operations are optimized for performance, allowing for efficient data processing even on large datasets.


To group cars by their maker, you can use the following aggregation query:

```javascript
db.cars.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$maker"}}])

**Result:**
[
  { _id: 'Hyundai' },
  { _id: 'Mahindra' },
  { _id: 'Maruti Suzuki' },
  { _id: 'Honda' },
  { _id: 'Tata' }
]


**Aggregation Example: Count Total Cars by Maker**

```javascript
db.cars.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$maker", TotalCars: { $sum: 1 } } }
])



**Result:**
[
  { _id: 'Hyundai', TotalCars: 4 },
  { _id: 'Honda', TotalCars: 3 },
  { _id: 'Maruti Suzuki', TotalCars: 3 },
  { _id: 'Mahindra', TotalCars: 1 },
  { _id: 'Tata', TotalCars: 3 }
]
